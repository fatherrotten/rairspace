SUBJ: Special Use Airspace
1. Purpose of This Order. This order, published yearly, provides a listing of all regulatory and 
non-regulatory special use airspace areas, as well as issued but not yet implemented amendments 
to those areas established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
2. Audience. Airspace and Aeronautical Operations personnel, Air Traffic Controllers, and 
interested aviation parties.
3. Where Can I Find This Order. You can find this order on the FAA Air Traffic Plans and 
Publications website at http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/, and the FAA employees’ 
website at htts://employees.faa.gov/tools_resources/orders_notices/.
4. What This Order Cancels. FAA Order JO 7400.10B, Special Use Airspace, dated 
February 16, 2020 is canceled.
5. Effective Date. February 16, 2021.
6. Background. Actions establishing, amending, or revoking regulatory and non-regulatory 
designations of special use airspace areas, in the United States and its territories, are issued by the 
FAA throughout the year. Regulatory special use airspace actions (see Part I of this order) are 
published in both the Federal Register and the National Flight Data Digest (NFDD). Nonregulatory special use airspace actions (see Part II of this order) are published only in the NFDD. 
These actions are generally effective on dates coinciding with the periodic issuance of 
Aeronautical Navigation Products navigational charts. For ease of reference, the FAA is 
providing the compilation of all regulatory and non-regulatory special use airspace areas in effect 
and pending as of January 26, 2021.
Since revisions to this order are not published between editions, the order should be used for 
general reference only and not as a sole source of information where accurate positional data are 
required (e.g., video maps, letter of agreement, etc.). All positional data used in this order are 
based on the North American Datum of 1983. No substantive change to any airspace designation 
is made by this effort. All substantive amendments to special use airspace have been adopted 
and published previously in accordance with 5 U.S.C. sections 552 and 553.

Part I – Regulatory Special Use Airspace Areas
Subpart A - General
§73.1 Applicability. 
The airspace that is described in Subpart B and Subpart C of this part is designated as special use 
airspace. These parts prescribe the requirements for the use of that airspace.
§73.3 Special Use Airspace. 
(a) Special use airspace consists of airspace of defined dimensions identified by an area on 
the surface of the earth wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, or 
wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those 
activities, or both. 
(b) The vertical limits of special use airspace are measured by designated altitude floors 
and ceilings expressed as flight levels or as feet above mean sea level (MSL). Unless 
otherwise specified, the word "to" (an altitude or flight level) means "to and including" (that 
altitude or flight level).
(c) The horizontal limits of special use airspace are measured by boundaries described by 
geographic coordinates or other appropriate references that clearly define their perimeter.
 (d) The period of time during which a designation of special use airspace is in effect is 
stated in the designation.
§73.5 Bearings, Radials, and Miles.
 (a) All bearings and radials in this part are true from point of origin. 
(b) Unless otherwise specified, all mileages in this part are stated as statute miles.2/16/21 JO 7400.10C

Subpart B – Restricted Areas
§73.11 Applicability. 
This subpart designates restricted areas and prescribes limitations on the operation of aircraft 
within them.
§73.13 Restrictions. 
No person may operate an aircraft within a restricted area between the designated altitudes and 
during the time of designation, unless he has the advance permission of: 
 (a) The using agency described in §73.15; or 
 (b) The controlling agency described in §73.17. 
§73.15 Using Agency. 
 (a) For the purposes of this subpart, the following are using agencies: 
 (1) The agency, organization, or military command whose activity within a restricted 
area necessitated the area being so designated.
 (2) [Reserved]
 (b) Upon the request of the FAA, the using agency shall execute a letter establishing 
procedures for joint use of a restricted area by the using agency and the controlling agency, 
under which the using agency would notify the controlling agency whenever the controlling 
agency may grant permission for transit through the restricted area in accordance with the 
terms of the letter.
(c) The using agency shall:
 (1) Schedule activities within the restricted area;
 (2) Authorize transit through, or flight within, the restricted area as feasible; and
 (3) Contain within the restricted area all activities conducted therein in accordance 
with the purpose for which it was designated. 
§73.17 Controlling Agency. 
For the purposes of this part, the controlling agency is the FAA facility that may authorize transit 
through or flight within a restricted area in accordance with a joint-use letter issued under 
§73.15. 2/16/21 JO 7400.10C 
3 
§73.19 Reports by Using Agency. 
(a) Each using agency shall prepare a report on the use of each restricted area assigned 
thereto during any part of the preceding 12-month period ended September 30, and transmit 
it by the following January 31 of each year to the Manager, Air Traffic Division in the 
regional office of the Federal Aviation Administration having jurisdiction over the area in 
which the restricted area is located, with a copy to the Director, Office of Air Traffic 
System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC 20591. 
 (b) In the report under this section the using agency shall: 
 (1) State the name and number of the restricted area as published in this part, and the 
period covered by the report. 
 (2) State the activities (including average daily number of operations if appropriate) 
conducted in the area, and any other pertinent information concerning current and 
future electronic monitoring devices. 
 (3) State the number of hours daily, the days of the week, and the number of weeks 
during the year that the area was used. Letter was emailed to the OE petitioner and 
uploaded to the KSN. KSN action is closed. 
 (4) For restricted areas having a joint-use designation, also state the number of hours 
daily, the days of the week, and the number of weeks during the year that the 
restricted area was released to the controlling agency for public use.
 (5) State the mean sea level altitudes or flight levels (whichever is appropriate) used 
in aircraft operations and the maximum and average ordinate of surface firing 
(expressed in feet, mean sea level altitude) used on a daily, weekly, and yearly basis.
 (6) Include a chart of the area (of optional scale and design) depicting, if used, 
aircraft operating areas, flight patterns, ordnance delivery areas, surface firing points, 
and target, fan, and impact areas. After once submitting an appropriate chart, 
subsequent annual charts are not required unless there is a change in the area activity 
or altitude (or flight levels) used, which might alter the depiction of the activities 
originally reported. If no change is to be submitted, a statement indicating "no 
change" shall be included in the report. 
 (7) Include any other information not otherwise required under this part which is 
considered pertinent to activities carried on in the restricted area.2/16/21 JO 7400.10C 
4 
 (c) If it is determined that the information submitted under paragraph (b) of this section is 
not sufficient to evaluate the nature and extent of the use of a restricted area, the FAA may 
request the using agency to submit supplementary reports. Within 60 days after receiving a 
request for additional information, the using agency shall submit such information as the 
Director, Office of Air Traffic System Management considers appropriate. Supplementary 
reports must be sent to the FAA officials designated in paragraph (a) of this section.

Part II – Nonregulatory Special Use Airspace Areas
Subpart A - General
General. 
Horizontal Limits. The horizontal limits of special use airspace are defined by 
geographic coordinates or other appropriate references that clearly describe their 
boundaries. 
Vertical Limits. 
a. Vertical limits are established as necessary to contain the planned activities.
 b. Within areas solely containing aircraft operations, altitudes at or above 18,000 
feet MSL are expressed as flight levels. Within areas containing other than aircraft 
operations, altitudes at or above 18,000 feet MSL are expressed as feet above mean 
sea level (MSL).
 c. Below 18,000 feet MSL, altitudes are expressed to the nearest 100 feet. Above 
18,000 feet MSL, altitudes/flight levels are to the nearest 500 feet. 
 d. Procedures for determining the floor of special use airspace vary according to 
area type and are contained in the appropriate chapters in Handbook 7400.2 
Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters.
e. Ceilings are expressed as flight levels or feet above MSL. Unless otherwise 
specified, the word "to" an altitude or flight level means "to and including" that 
altitude or flight level. If the vertical limit does not include the altitude or flight 
level, the ceiling is expressed as "to but not including." 
Times of use. Times of use are expressed in the local time of the using agency using the 
24-hour clock. 
Controlling agency. An FAA or military facility is assigned as the controlling agency. 
This is not applicable, when the airspace will not be joint use. 2/16/21 JO 7400.10C 
158 
Using agency. Normally, the using agency is the agency, organization or military 
command whose activity established the requirement for the special use airspace. An 
ATC facility may be the using agency for joint use areas when the facility is specified in 
a letter of procedure as having priority for use of the area.
Subpart B - Military Operations Areas
Definition. 
A Military Operations Area (MOA) is airspace established outside of Class A airspace to 
separate/segregate certain nonhazardous military activities from IFR traffic and to 
identify for VFR traffic where these activities are conducted.
Activities.
MOA's are established to contain certain military activities such as air combat 
maneuvers, air intercepts, acrobatics, etc.

Subpart E – National Security Areas 
Definition.
A national security area (NSA) consists of airspace of defined vertical and lateral
dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased security of 
ground facilities. The purpose of such national security areas is to request pilot cooperation 
by voluntarily avoiding flight through the NSA. 
When circumstances dictate a need for a greater level of security, flight in an NSA may be 
temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions of 14 CFR Section 99.7, Special 
Security Instructions.
Such prohibitions will be issued by FAA Headquarters and disseminated via the U.S. 
NOTAM System.
